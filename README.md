## Goal 
. This work is to reproduct a full CSS form a model.

It consists to adapt the same site on mobile device too.

I think that begin by the mobile site is more easy to adapt in desktop after.

Start with the desktop site can make some problems to be solved to the adaptation.

. Write meaningful, semantically correct HTML.
## Outils
The flex and the grid are two models that we can use to create more easely the stucture.
